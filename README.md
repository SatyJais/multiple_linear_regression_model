# Multiple Linear Regression Model
Part of Google Advanced Data Analysis Certification

### Build a multiple linear regression model to predict taxi fares using existing data that was collected over the course of a year. 

## Data Import and Exploration

Loading the dataset using pandas.

Inspecting the data structure, checking for missing values, and understanding the data types.

## Data Preprocessing

Handling missing values through imputation or removal.

Encoding categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding.

Normalizing or standardizing numerical features if necessary.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Visualizing relationships between variables using plots such as scatter plots, histograms, and box plots.

Calculating correlation coefficients to identify multicollinearity.

## Model Building

Splitting the dataset into training and testing sets.

Fitting a multiple linear regression model using scikit-learn.

Interpreting the coefficients to understand the impact of each feature.

## Model Evaluation

Assessing the model's performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).

Analyzing residuals to check for patterns that might indicate model inadequacies.

## Conclusion
